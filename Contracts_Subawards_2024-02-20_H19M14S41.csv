 DESPITE THE ONGOING INTEREST FOR ADOPTING DISTRIBUTED SOLAR GENERATION, THE MARKET STILL NEEDS CLEAR SIGNALS AND THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE HIGHEST OFFICES OF THE GOVERNMENT TO EFFECTIVELY ENCOURAGE THE PUBLIC ADOPTION OF CLEAN AND DISTRIBUTED TECHNOLOGY. THEREFORE, THROUGH ITS ENERGY SECURITY FUND (ESF), MESA IS INSTALLING A SOLAR PV SYSTEM ON MOLDOVAÂ  S PRESIDENTIAL COMPLEX. MESA WILL INSTALL A DISTRIBUTED SOLAR GENERATION PLANT TO SERVE AS A PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION TO HIGHLIGHT THE GOVERNMENT OF MOLDOVAÂ  S COMMITMENT TO ACHIEVE NATIONAL CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT GOALS TO CATALYZE A WIDER ADOPTION OF CLEAN GENERATION. IN PARALLEL, THIS DEMONSTRATION WILL HIGHLIGHT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ADVANCED, HIGH EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGY WHILE CONTRIBUTING TO THE COMPLEXÂ  S ELECTRICITY RELIABILITY AND SECURITY OF SUPPLY.
 TO ACCOMMODATE PLANNED CONSTRUCTION ON THE PRESIDENTIAL ROOFTOP, THIS SOLAR PV PROJECT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN TWO PHASES.
 
 PHASE 1: THE FIRST PHASE WILL INCLUDE INSTALLATION OF 65KW SOLAR PV ON THE WINGS OF THE MAIN BUILDING.
 
 PHASE 2: WILL BE DISCUSSED THE PRESIDENTIAL COMPLEX AFTER ROOF REPLACEMENT AND ATTIC CONSTRUCTION ON THE SECURITY BUILDING. TETRA TECH WILL AUTHORIZE METNOX TO MOVE FORWARD ONCE IT IS CONFIRMED WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL COMPLEX.
 
 IN THIS CONTEXT, METNOX, AT THE DIRECTION OF THE CHIEF OF PARTY, MESA AND THE OBJECTIVE 2 LEAD, IS TASKED WITH PROCURING AND INSTALLING THE BELOW DESCRIBED TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR SOLAR PV PANELS. METNOX WILL DELIVER AND INSTALL GOODS DIRECTLY TO THE PROJECT SITE AT THE PRESIDENTIAL COMPLEX, IN STRICT ACCORDANCE WITH THE TECHNICAL DESIGN FOR THE PV SYTEM.

 ACTIVITY 1: STOCHASTIC MODELING OF COASTAL STORM SURGE AND WAVE USING HISTORICAL HURRICANE DATA
 Â ¢ ARGONNE WILL PERFORM WORK RELATED TO COASTAL STORM SURGE AND WAVE SIMULATIONS BASED ON HISTORICAL HURRICANE REALIZATIONS.
 ACTIVITY 2: PERFORM RELIABILITY ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY VULNERABLE RAILWAY SEGMENTS FOR SHORT-TERM PLANNING
 Â ¢ THE RESULTS FROM THE COASTAL STORM SURGE AND WAVE SIMULATIONS IN ACTIVITY 1 WILL BE USED TO PERFORM THE RELIABILITY ANALYSIS FOR SHORT-TERM PLANNING BY MTU.
 ACTIVITY 3: PREDICT LONG-TERM VULNERABILITIES IN COASTAL RAIL SYSTEM SUBJECTED TO STORM HAZARDS AND SEA LEVEL RISE
 Â ¢ ARGONNE WILL PERFORM WORK RELATED TO COASTAL STORM SURGE AND WAVE SIMULATIONS BASED ON PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE HURRICANE HAZARDS AND SEA LEVEL RISE. MTU WILL USE THESE FOR PERFORMING RELIABILITY ANALYSIS FOR LONG-TERM PLANNING SIMILAR TO ACTIVITY 2.
 
 
 DETAILED WORK DESCRIPTION:
 PHASE 1: SHORT-TERM RAILWAY PLANNING WP1: LITERATURE REVIEW
 TASK 1.1 - CONDUCT A LITERATURE REVIEW: ARGONNE, ALONG WITH THE TEAM AT MTU, WILL CONDUCT A THOROUGH LITERATURE REVIEW TO DETERMINE THE CURRENT PRACTICE ON PROBABILISTIC RISK ASSESSMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS AGAINST STORM RELATED HAZARDS. ARGONNE WILL FOCUS ON LITERATURE RELATED TO HURRICANE/STORM MODELING INCLUDING MAXIMUM WIND SPEED AND STORM TRACK GENERATION, SURGE AND WAVE MODELING, SURGE SURROGATE MODELING TECHNIQUES, AND THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON HURRICANES AND SEA LEVEL RISE.
 DELIVERABLE: LITERATURE REVIEW REPORT.
 
 
 WP2: DATA COLLECTION:
 TASK 2.1 - OBTAIN GEOSPATIAL DATA AND MODEL BOUNDARY CONDITION DATA: TO SIMULATE SURGE, WAVES AND COASTAL INUNDATION, ARGONNE, ALONG WITH THE TEAM AT MTU, WILL COLLECT GEOSPATIAL DATA SUCH AS BATHYMETRY AND TOPOGRAPHY, LEVEE SYSTEMS, AND LAND-USE TYPES. IN ADDITION, ESTIMATES OF FLOWRATES AT UPSTREAM RIVER LOCATIONS AND ASTRONOMICAL TIDE SOLUTIONS ALONG OPEN OCEAN BOUNDARIES OF THE MODEL, AND ADJUSTMENTS TO THE MEAN SEA LEVEL CONSIDERING SEASONAL AND LONG-TERM VARIATIONS (SEA LEVEL RISE) WILL BE COLLECTED AND DISTRIBUTED.
  
 TASK 2.2 Â   COLLECT HISTORICAL STORMS DATA: TO PROVIDE THE WIND FORCING DATA FOR THE SURGE AND WAVE SIMULATIONS, ARGONNE, ALONG WITH THE TEAM AT MTU, WILL COLLECT THE ACTUAL HISTORICAL (1850-PRESENT) AND A SYNTHETIC HISTORICAL (10,000 YEARS) DATASET OF TROPICAL CYCLONE/HURRICANE DATA FOR THE NORTH ATLANTIC AND GULF OF MEXICO COASTLINES, WHICH INCLUDE INFORMATION SUCH AS THE DATE AND TIME, LOCATION, MAXIMUM WIND SPEED, MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE, AND THE RADIUS OF EACH HURRICANE TRACK.
 DELIVERABLE: SHARED DATABASE CONTAINING COLLECTED DATA.
 
 
 WP3: STORM AND SURGE+WAVE MODEL DATA GENERATION
 TASK 3.1 - GENERATE ANNUAL STORM/HURRICANE PROBABILITIES AS A FUNCTION OF MAXIMUM WIND SPEED: THE TEAM AT MTU, ALONG WITH ARGONNE, WILL GROUP THE SYNTHETIC HISTORICAL STORM DATA BY THE MAXIMUM WIND SPEED OF THE STORM THAT ENTERS THE TESTBED REGION. THE RECORDED NUMBER OF STORMS FOR EACH WIND SPEED INTERVAL WILL BE USED TO ESTIMATE THE RETURN PERIOD FOR EACH WIND INTERVAL BY DIVIDING THE NUMBER OF STORM YEARS (10,000) BY THE NUMBER OF STORMS IN THAT INTERVAL. THE ANNUAL EXCEEDANCE PROBABILITY (AEP) OF WIND BELONGING TO A SPECIFIC WIND SPEED INTERVAL IS RELATED TO RETURN PERIOD OF THE WIND GROUP THROUGH THE CUMULATIVE DENSITY FUNCTION (CDF) OF THE EXPONENTIAL DISTRIBUTION.
 TASK 3.2 - SETUP AND VALIDATE COUPLED STORM SURGE-WAVE MODEL: ARGONNE, ALONG WITH THE TEAM AT MTU, WILL DEVELOP A COUPLED STORM SURGE AND WAVE MODEL BASED ON THE ADCIRC-SWAN CODE. THIS WILL INVOLVE CREATING THE UNSTRUCTURED MESH AND MODEL PARAMETERS, WHICH WILL BE HANDLED USING THE OCEANMESH2D TOOLBOX THAT DR. PRINGLE CO-DEVELOPED. MODEL PARAMETERS THAT ADCIRC-SWAN REQUIRES TO SIMULATE WATER LEVELS AND WAVE HEIGHTS ARE DERIVED USING THE DATA COLLECTED IN TASK 2.1.

 TASK 3) FIELD VALIDATION
 TASK 4) TESTING IN A SIM. ENV.
 TASK 5) SUMMARY PUB AND REPORT
 TASK 1: SNOW PROPERTY INVERSION FROM REMOTE SENSING FOR PYTHON (SPIPY) SENTINEL
 IN REMOTE SENSING THERE IS AN INESCAPABLE TRADEOFF BETWEEN SPATIAL, TEMPORAL, AND SPECTRAL
 RESOLUTION. THIS TRADE SPACE HAS NOT BEEN EXPLORED FOR MOBILITY APPLICATIONS OVER SNOW. OFTEN,
 THERE IS NO Â  SILVER BULLETÂ   SINGLE SOLUTION. TO GET HIGH SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION, MULTIPLE
 TECHNOLOGIES NEED TO BE UTILIZED. WE WILL EXPLORE HOW ASSIMILATION OF HIGH SPATIAL, SPECTRAL, AND
 TEMPORAL RESOLUTION PRODUCTS CAN IMPROVE SNOW MOBILITY MAPS, FOCUSING ON HOW ROUTE FINDING IS
 IMPROVED.
 WE WILL FOCUS ON REMOTE SENSING RETRIEVALS OF THE SNOW SURFACE AT A 10 M SPATIAL RESOLUTION
 COVERING DIVISION SIZED AREAS. WE WILL UTILIZE SENTINEL 2A&B, A NEXT GENERATION MULTISPECTRAL PAIR
 OF SATELLITE SENSORS WITH 5-DAY REPEAT COVERAGE AT 10-20 M SPATIAL RESOLUTION WITH A SURFACE
 REFLECTANCE PRODUCT IN THE VISIBLE THROUGH NEAR-INFRARED BANDS. WE WILL DOWNSCALE THE ADDITIONAL
 NEEDED SHORTWAVE INFRARED BANDS, FROM 20 M TO 10 M SPATIAL RESOLUTION. WE WILL USE SPIRES (BAIR
 ET AL., 2021) THAT IS BEING CONVERTED TO PYTHON FOR USE IN THE ARCGIS PRO ENVIRONMENT (FIGURE 1).
 WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THE ALBEDO ESTIMATES FROM THE SENTINEL 2 BOTTOM OF ATMOSPHERE REFLECTANCE
 PRODUCT (LEVEL 2) MATCH MEASURED ALBEDOS FROM CUES. WE WILL IMPROVE THE SPEED OF SPIPY USING
 ADDITIONAL MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES, EXPANDED INDEXING OF UNIQUE SPECTRA, AND/OR NUMERICAL
 SOLUTIONS WITH FASTER CONVERGENCE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON CLOUD MASKING AND CLOUD/SNOW
 DISCRIMINATION (STILLINGER ET AL., 2019).
 TASK U1 DELIVERABLES
 COLLABORATIVE DATACUBES OF SNOW SURFACE, SNOWPACK, AND SUBSURFACE PROPERTIES. THESE CUBES
 WILL ALSO COVER THE SAME GRID AS DESCRIBED ABOVE (10 M GRID
 PAGE 2 OF 6
 OVER A 50,000-90,000 KM2), AT AN HOURLY TIMESTEP FOR A WATER YEAR. LAYERS COULD INCLUDE: A SOIL
 LAYER WITH PROPERTIES OF THE SOIL BENEATH THE SNOW (OR EXPOSED IN SNOW FREE LOCATIONS), TAKING INTO
 ACCOUNT RECENTLY BURNED AREAS; SNOWPACK LAYERS COMPOSED OF A MULTI-LAYERED SNOWPACK WITH
 DENSITY INFORMATION FOR THE LAYERS RELEVANT TO MOBILITY MAPPING; AND A SNOW SURFACE LAYER, WITH
 SURFACE PROPERTIES RELEVANT TO MOBILITY. THESE DATA COULD BE USED TO FORCE ADDITIONAL MOBILITY
 PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE. THESE DATACUBES WILL BE USED TO CALIBRATE AND VALIDATE SNOW MODELING
 APPROACHES PERFORMED BY ALL INSTITUTIONS.
 TASK 2: REMOTE SENSING AND MODELING CONNECTION
 THE REMOTELY SENSED SNOW SURFACE COMPONENTS (FRACTIONAL SNOW-COVERED AREA; GRAIN SIZE; AND
 IMPURITY CONCENTRATION) CAN ALSO BE PRODUCED BY MODELS, SUCH AS COUPLED LAND-ATMOSPHERIC
 MODELS, SUCH AS NOAH (NATIONAL CENTERS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PREDICTION/OREGON STATE
 UNIVERSITY/AIR FORCE/HYDROLOGY LAB OF THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE), WRF (WEATHER RESEARCH
 AND FORECASTING MODEL) AND ELM (ENERGY EXASCALE EARTH SYSTEM MODEL LAND SURFACE MODEL).
 OUR CURRENT SURFACE ENERGY BALANCE MODEL (PARBAL, BAIR ET AL., 2016, CODE:
 HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/EDWARDBAIR/PARBAL) DOES NOT REQUIRE PRECIPITATION AS AN INPUT, PERHAPS THE MOST
 UNCERTAIN MASS BALANCE TERM. THIS OMISSION COMES AT THE EXPENSE OF IGNORING SUBSURFACE PROPERTIES
 RELEVANT FOR MOBILITY (DENSITY, INDICES OF STRENGTH, STRATIGRAPHY). HOWEVER, PARBAL HAS BEEN SHOWN

BHA PROVIDES PRINCIPLED, LIFESAVING HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO THE WORLDÂ  S MOST VULNERABLE AND HARDEST-TO-REACH PEOPLE. BHA IS THE LEAD FEDERAL COORDINATOR FOR INTERNATIONAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE, HARNESSING THE UNIQUE CAPACITIES OF OTHER U.S. GOVERNMENT (USG) ENTITIES TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO NATURAL DISASTERS AND COMPLEX CRISES AROUND THE WORLD; BHA RESPONDS TO EMERGENCIES IN MORE THAN 70 COUNTRIES EVERY YEAR. BHA ALSO SUPPORTS EARLY RECOVERY AND RESILIENCE EFFORTS TO MITIGATE AND REDUCE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE THREATS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND TO RESTORE AND PROTECT BASIC SYSTEMS AND SERVICES. IT ACHIEVES ITS MANDATE IN COORDINATION WITH AFFECTED POPULATIONS, DONOR AND HOST GOVERNMENTS, PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, CIVIL SOCIETY, AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR.  
 
  
 
 IN AN EFFORT TO KEEP PACE WITH ESCALATING GLOBAL HUMANITARIAN NEEDS, BHA HAS SEEN A MORE THAN FOUR-FOLD INCREASE IN ITS BUDGET SINCE 2011 AND IS THE SINGLE LARGEST DONOR TO KEY HUMANITARIAN AGENCIES SUCH AS THE UN WFP, UN OCHA, AND UNICEF.  
 
  
 
 BHA IS INITIATING AN INTERNAL PROCESS TO DEVELOP A FORWARD-LOOKING, FIVE-YEAR BUREAU-LEVEL VISION/PLAN THAT WILL IDENTIFY AND ESTABLISH BHAÂ  S CORE PRIORITIES AND SHAPE FUTURE INVESTMENTS.  THIS PLAN/VISION PAPER IS INTENDED TO FOCUS BHAÂ  S PRIORITIES AND STREAMLINE WORK TO ULTIMATELY ENSURE BHA REMAINS A HIGHLY EFFICIENT PRACTITIONER AND GLOBAL THOUGHT LEADER IN EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND PREPAREDNESS, OPERATIONAL READINESS, AND HUMANITARIAN ADVOCACY AND POLICY, IN AN EVOLVING AND CHANGING WORLD. THIS PLAN/VISION PAPER WILL ENHANCE SYNERGIES BETWEEN RELEVANT BHA POLICIES AND PRIORITIES, INCLUDING THE HUMANITARIAN ACTION POLICY, ER4 STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK, AND POLICY FOR LOCALIZATION OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE, AMONG OTHERS. THE PAPER WILL ALIGN WITH BROADER USAID POLICIES AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THE REVISED  USAID POLICY FRAMEWORK AND USAIDÂ  S CLIMATE STRATEGY. THE PLAN/VISION PAPER WILL NOT BE A Â  STRATEGYÂ   IN THAT IT WILL NOT IDENTIFY A SET OF MEASURABLE, TIME-BOUND OBJECTIVES NOR METRICS.  
 
  
 
 POTENTIAL AREAS OF INTEREST/QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED IN THE PLAN/VISION (NOT COMPREHENSIVE OR FINAL): 
 
 FUNDING MODEL.  
 
 WHAT WOULD BE THE OPTIMAL USE OF BHAÂ  S FUNDING GIVEN PROJECTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE HUMANITARIAN LANDSCAPE, E.G. THOSE DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE, SECONDARY IMPACTS OF GLOBAL PANDEMICS, SHIFTS IN THE CAUSES AND NATURE OF CONFLICT?  
 
 SHOULD BHA GIVE MORE/LESS FUNDING THROUGH UN POOLED FUNDS? SHOULD BHA RELY MORE HEAVILY ON GLOBAL AND/OR MACRO AWARDS TO THE UN AND OTHER PIOS?  
 
 SHOULD BHA PROVIDE MORE FUNDING TO A SMALLER NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, OR CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SMALLER AMOUNTS OF FUNDING ACROSS A LARGER NUMBER OF COUNTRIES (DEPTH VS. BREADTH)? WHAT ARE RISKS AND TRADE-OFFS TO THAT APPROACH? 
 
 TO WHAT EXTENT SHOULD BHA INVEST IN SYSTEMS/INFRASTRUCTURE/PIPELINES (E.G. SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS, NUTRITION COMMODITY SUPPLY CHAIN) CRITICAL FOR THE DELIVERY OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE?  
 
 WHAT IS THE MOST EFFICIENT/EFFECTIVE WAY TO FUND FOOD ASSISTANCE FOR REFUGEES?  
 
 ROLE IN THE SYSTEM.  
 
 WHAT IS/SHOULD BE BHAÂ  S ROLE IN COMPLEX, PROTRACTED EMERGENCIES Â   AND WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE TO REMAIN ENGAGED WITH/WITHOUT A DART/RMT STRUCTURE?  
 
 WHAT IS/SHOULD BE BHAÂ  S ROLE IN SITUATIONS OF PROTRACTED CONFLICT  AND EMERGENCIES WITH RESPECT TO WORKING WITHIN THE HDP NEXUS? 
 
 WHAT IS BHAÂ  S ROLE IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS PERMANENT IMPACT ON THE LANDSCAPE (E.G. RECURRING SHOCKS)?  
 
 WHAT IS BHAÂ  S ROLE WITH REGARDS TO LONGER-TERM RESILIENCE PROGRAMMING? 
 
 WHAT IS BHAÂ  S ROLE IN ADVANCING DEIA-SENSITIVE PROGRAMMING AND HUMANITARIAN POLICY/DIPLOMACY? 
 
 PARTNERSHIP.  
 
 BUILDING ON THE LOCALIZATION POLICY, WHAT CHANGES ARE NEEDED IN BHAÂ  S PARTNERSHIP APPROACHES TO BETTER SUPPORT MORE LOCALLY-LED HUMANITARIAN RESPONSES? HOW CAN BHA BETTER HOLD PARTNERS (PIO, NGO) TO ACCOUNT FOR IMPROVING LOCALIZATION? 
 
 DATA.  
 
 HOW CAN BHA IMPROVE AND/OR BETTER USE DATA AND ANALYSIS TO INFORM FUNDING/PROGRAM DECISIONS, INCLUDING TO INFORM ANTICIPATORY ACTIONS?  
 
 DOES BHA NEED TO MAKE DIFFERENT INVESTMENTS IN DATA AND ANALYSIS TO ACHIEVE THIS; IF SO, WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE? 
 
 BHA ENVISIONS A PHASED APPROACH OF ACTIVITIES. THIS IS INTENDED TO BE A CONSULTATIVE PROCESS AND DONE IN COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION WITH THE BHA FRONT OFFICE AND A BHA STEERING COMMITTEE. 
 
  
 
 PHASE 1: REFINING THE SCOPE AND PARAMETERS OF THE BHA VISION PLAN (BUILDING ON POTENTIAL AREAS OF INTEREST NOTED ABOVE). THIS WOULD INVOLVE:

 SNOW MELT DETECTION USING CALIBRATED ENHANCED-RESOLUTION BRIGHTNESS
 TEMPERATURES (CETB) AND PIXEL-LEVEL VARIABILITY STATISTICS: IMPLICATIONS FOR SNOW
 WATER EQUIVALENT ESTIMATION, RUNOFF TIMING, AND MOBILITY
 01 AUG 2020 Â   31 JULY 2023
 UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO PI: MARY J. BRODZIK
 STATEMENT OF WORK
 THE OCCURRENCE OF MELT ONSET IS A CHARACTERISTIC PHYSICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL PHENOMENON IN COLD
 REGIONS. TIMING, DURATION AND INTENSITY OF MELT DIRECTLY AFFECT SNOWPACK STRENGTH AND STRUCTURE,
 ENERGY FLUXES, AND RUNOFF TIMING AND MAGNITUDE. IN A COLD, DRY, SNOW PACK, MULTI-FREQUENCY
 TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS ARE CORRELATED WITH INCREASED VOLUME SCATTERING, AND USED TO ESTIMATE SNOW
 WATER EQUIVALENT. HOWEVER, IN THE PRESENCE OF EVEN SMALL AMOUNTS OF LIQUID WATER AT OBSERVED
 PENETRATION DEPTHS, THE TEMPERATURE GRADIENT FROM VOLUME SCATTERING IS OVERCOME BY INCREASED
 EMISSION FROM LIQUID WATER. PASSIVE MICROWAVE (PM) MELT ONSET DETECTION USES ANALYSIS OF
 DIURNAL AMPLITUDE VARIATION (DAV) TIME SERIES TO IDENTIFY THE ONSET OF TYPICAL DAYTIME MELT WITH
 NIGHTTIME REFREEZE, AND TO IDENTIFY THE DURATION OF THIS MELT/REFREEZE CYCLING.
 ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED USING COARSE RESOLUTION PM OBSERVATIONS AT 25 KM SAMPLING AND GRIDDING
 RESOLUTIONS ON MEDIUM TO LARGE GLACIERIZED AREAS, WE HAVE RECENTLY DEMONSTRATED THAT ENHANCED
 SPATIAL RESOLUTION PM OBSERVATIONS CAN NOW BE EFFECTIVELY USED IN MORE HETEROGENOUS
 LANDSCAPES, INCLUDING LAND/WATER GRADIENTS AND TOPOGRAPHICALLY COMPLEX REGIONS. WE WILL BE
 USING THE NASA MEASURES CALIBRATED, ENHANCED-RESOLUTION BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURES
 (CETB) EARTH SYSTEM DATA RECORD (ESDR) TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND EVALUATE DAV ALGORITHM
 DETECTION OF MELT ONSET. WE WILL LEVERAGE THE IMPROVED SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF CETB PRODUCTS, AT
 3.125 KM, COMPARED TO 25 KM RESOLUTION OF LEGACY DATA PRODUCTS, WITH NEWLY-AVAILABLE PIXELLEVEL
 VARIABILITY STATISTICS, TO DEVELOP DAV ALGORITHM THRESHOLDS APPROPRIATE FOR SELECTED CLIMATE
 REGIMES AND LANDSCAPES.
 TO SUPPORT US ARMY ERDC OBJECTIVES TO USE THE PROPOSED RESEARCH TO SUPPORT ARMY OPERATIONAL
 MOBILITY GOALS, WE WILL DEFINE, DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT DATA TRANSFER WORKFLOWS FOR INGESTING THE
 CETB DATA INTO AN ONLINE GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS) DATA PORTAL THAT WILL BE HOSTED AT
 CRREL AS A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT SYSTEM. THE GIS PORTAL WILL BE USED TO DEMONSTRATE GIS ANALYST
 USE CASES, POSING QUESTIONS ABOUT COLD REGIONS STATUS OF SNOW COVER AND MELT ONSET DERIVED FROM
 SATELLITE PM OBSERVATIONS. THE LONG RECORD OF CETB DATA PROVIDES A VALUABLE CLIMATOLOGICAL
 CONTEXT FOR INTERPRETATION OF OBSERVED CONDITIONS. THE SPATIAL COVERAGE OF CETB DATA PROVIDES
 REGIONAL CONTEXT THAT CAN ONLY BE OBTAINED FROM SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS. WE WILL INGEST THE
 AVAILABLE HISTORICAL CETB RECORD FROM 6 SSM/I AND 4 SSMIS SENSORS INTO THE TEST PORTAL AT
 CRREL. WE WILL DELIVER AN OPEN SOURCE PYTHON LANGUAGE PACKAGE WITH ALGORITHMS FOR DERIVING
 SWE AND MELT ONSET FROM THE INGESTED CETB DATA GRIDS.
 THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO IS CURRENTLY FUNDED BY US ARMY ERDC TO EVALUATE SWE ALGORITHM
 IMPROVEMENTS USING NEAR REAL-TIME CETB DATA AS AN EXTENSION OF THE HISTORICAL CETB RECORD.
 THE PROPOSED RESEARCH CAN BE USED TO FURTHER IMPROVE ENHANCED-RESOLUTION SWE ESTIMATES, BY
 INDICATING AREAS AND TIMES WITH INCREASED UNCERTAINTY IN SWE ESTIMATES DUE TO DETECTED MELTING
 CONDITIONS. THE RESULTING MELT ONSET PRODUCT WILL PROVIDE A UNIQUE, SYSTEMATICALLY-DERIVED, 30+
 YEAR TIME SERIES OF MELT TIMING AND DURATION FOR REGIONS THAT ARE TOO REMOTE TO OBSERVE OTHER THAN
 BY REMOTE SENSING, AND WILL INCREASE THE UTILITY OF NEAR REAL-TIME SWE PRODUCTS USED FOR
 OPERATIONAL ARMY ACTIVITIES.
 THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO WILL SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF LEHIGH UNIVERSITY IN THE PROPOSED
 RESEARCH TASKS BY (1) HELPING TO COMPILE APPROPRIATE DATA SETS FOR EVALUATION AND VALIDATION OF
 MELT ONSET ALGORITHMS IN SELECTED CLIMATE/LANDSCAPE REGIMES, (2) PROVIDING APPROPRIATE CETB
 SPATIOTEMPORAL SUBSETS WITH ADDITIONAL PIXEL-LEVEL MEASUREMENT STATISTICS FOR DERIVING OPTIMIZED
 TEMPERATURE THRESHOLDS, (3) IMPLEMENTING EFFICIENT ALGORITHMS TO DERIVE MELT ONSET AND DURATION
 PRODUCTS, AND (4) USING CU SUPERCOMPUTING FACILITIES AND PETALIBRARY STORAGE SERVICES TO
 PERFORM ANALYSIS AND DATA PRODUCTION AT THE LOCATION OF THE CETB DATA ARCHIVE AT CU.
 THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO WILL SUPPORT THE PROPOSED GIS TASKS BY (1) WORKING WITH CRREL TO
 DEFINE AN APPROPRIATE WORKFLOW FOR CETB DATA INGEST TO THE CRREL DATA PORTAL, (2) USING THE
 NEW WORKFLOW TO INGEST THE HISTORICAL CETB SSM/I AND SSMIS SENSOR BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURE
 GRIDS INTO THE CRREL PORTAL BACKEND, AND (3) DELIVERING AN OPEN SOURCE PYTHON PACKAGE THAT CAN
 BE USED BY A GIS ANALYST USING THE CRREL PORTAL TO DERIVE GRIDDED PRODUCTS FROM CETB DATA.
 EARLY IN THE PROJECT, WE WILL PARTICIPATE IN A TECHNICAL PLANNING MEETING WITH COLLABORATORS AT
 LEHIGH UNIVERSITY. THEREAFTER, WE WILL COORDINATE WITH LEHIGH COLLABORATORS IN REGULARLY

 VARIABILITY STATISTICS, TO DEVELOP DAV ALGORITHM THRESHOLDS APPROPRIATE FOR SELECTED CLIMATE
 REGIMES AND LANDSCAPES.
 TO SUPPORT US ARMY ERDC OBJECTIVES TO USE THE PROPOSED RESEARCH TO SUPPORT ARMY OPERATIONAL
 MOBILITY GOALS, WE WILL DEFINE, DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT DATA TRANSFER WORKFLOWS FOR INGESTING THE
 CETB DATA INTO AN ONLINE GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS) DATA PORTAL THAT WILL BE HOSTED AT
 CRREL AS A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT SYSTEM. THE GIS PORTAL WILL BE USED TO DEMONSTRATE GIS ANALYST
 USE CASES, POSING QUESTIONS ABOUT COLD REGIONS STATUS OF SNOW COVER AND MELT ONSET DERIVED FROM
 SATELLITE PM OBSERVATIONS. THE LONG RECORD OF CETB DATA PROVIDES A VALUABLE CLIMATOLOGICAL
 CONTEXT FOR INTERPRETATION OF OBSERVED CONDITIONS. THE SPATIAL COVERAGE OF CETB DATA PROVIDES
 REGIONAL CONTEXT THAT CAN ONLY BE OBTAINED FROM SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS. WE WILL INGEST THE
 AVAILABLE HISTORICAL CETB RECORD FROM 6 SSM/I AND 4 SSMIS SENSORS INTO THE TEST PORTAL AT
 CRREL. WE WILL DELIVER AN OPEN SOURCE PYTHON LANGUAGE PACKAGE WITH ALGORITHMS FOR DERIVING
 SWE AND MELT ONSET FROM THE INGESTED CETB DATA GRIDS.
 THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO IS CURRENTLY FUNDED BY US ARMY ERDC TO EVALUATE SWE ALGORITHM
 IMPROVEMENTS USING NEAR REAL-TIME CETB DATA AS AN EXTENSION OF THE HISTORICAL CETB RECORD.
 THE PROPOSED RESEARCH CAN BE USED TO FURTHER IMPROVE ENHANCED-RESOLUTION SWE ESTIMATES, BY
 INDICATING AREAS AND TIMES WITH INCREASED UNCERTAINTY IN SWE ESTIMATES DUE TO DETECTED MELTING
 CONDITIONS. THE RESULTING MELT ONSET PRODUCT WILL PROVIDE A UNIQUE, SYSTEMATICALLY-DERIVED, 30+
 YEAR TIME SERIES OF MELT TIMING AND DURATION FOR REGIONS THAT ARE TOO REMOTE TO OBSERVE OTHER THAN
 BY REMOTE SENSING, AND WILL INCREASE THE UTILITY OF NEAR REAL-TIME SWE PRODUCTS USED FOR
 OPERATIONAL ARMY ACTIVITIES.
 THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO WILL SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF LEHIGH UNIVERSITY IN THE PROPOSED
 RESEARCH TASKS BY (1) HELPING TO COMPILE APPROPRIATE DATA SETS FOR EVALUATION AND VALIDATION OF
 MELT ONSET ALGORITHMS IN SELECTED CLIMATE/LANDSCAPE REGIMES, (2) PROVIDING APPROPRIATE CETB
 SPATIOTEMPORAL SUBSETS WITH ADDITIONAL PIXEL-LEVEL MEASUREMENT STATISTICS FOR DERIVING OPTIMIZED
 TEMPERATURE THRESHOLDS, (3) IMPLEMENTING EFFICIENT ALGORITHMS TO DERIVE MELT ONSET AND DURATION
 PRODUCTS, AND (4) USING CU SUPERCOMPUTING FACILITIES AND PETALIBRARY STORAGE SERVICES TO
 PERFORM ANALYSIS AND DATA PRODUCTION AT THE LOCATION OF THE CETB DATA ARCHIVE AT CU.
 THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO WILL SUPPORT THE PROPOSED GIS TASKS BY (1) WORKING WITH CRREL TO
 DEFINE AN APPROPRIATE WORKFLOW FOR CETB DATA INGEST TO THE CRREL DATA PORTAL, (2) USING THE
 NEW WORKFLOW TO INGEST THE HISTORICAL CETB SSM/I AND SSMIS SENSOR BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURE
 GRIDS INTO THE CRREL PORTAL BACKEND, AND (3) DELIVERING AN OPEN SOURCE PYTHON PACKAGE THAT CAN
 BE USED BY A GIS ANALYST USING THE CRREL PORTAL TO DERIVE GRIDDED PRODUCTS FROM CETB DATA.
 EARLY IN THE PROJECT, WE WILL PARTICIPATE IN A TECHNICAL PLANNING MEETING WITH COLLABORATORS AT
 LEHIGH UNIVERSITY. THEREAFTER, WE WILL COORDINATE WITH LEHIGH COLLABORATORS IN REGULARLY
 SCHEDULED TELECONS AND ASSIST IN PRESENTING RESULTS IN PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL PAPERS.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_W913E521C0015_9700_-NONE-_-NONE-/,2023-10-11 16:04:54+00

 SNOW MELT DETECTION USING CALIBRATED ENHANCED-RESOLUTION BRIGHTNESS
 TEMPERATURES (CETB) AND PIXEL-LEVEL VARIABILITY STATISTICS: IMPLICATIONS FOR SNOW
 WATER EQUIVALENT ESTIMATION, RUNOFF TIMING, AND MOBILITY
 01 AUG 2020 Â   31 JULY 2023
 UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO PI: MARY J. BRODZIK
 STATEMENT OF WORK
 THE OCCURRENCE OF MELT ONSET IS A CHARACTERISTIC PHYSICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL PHENOMENON IN COLD
 REGIONS. TIMING, DURATION AND INTENSITY OF MELT DIRECTLY AFFECT SNOWPACK STRENGTH AND STRUCTURE,
 ENERGY FLUXES, AND RUNOFF TIMING AND MAGNITUDE. IN A COLD, DRY, SNOW PACK, MULTI-FREQUENCY
 TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS ARE CORRELATED WITH INCREASED VOLUME SCATTERING, AND USED TO ESTIMATE SNOW
 WATER EQUIVALENT. HOWEVER, IN THE PRESENCE OF EVEN SMALL AMOUNTS OF LIQUID WATER AT OBSERVED
 PENETRATION DEPTHS, THE TEMPERATURE GRADIENT FROM VOLUME SCATTERING IS OVERCOME BY INCREASED
 EMISSION FROM LIQUID WATER. PASSIVE MICROWAVE (PM) MELT ONSET DETECTION USES ANALYSIS OF
 DIURNAL AMPLITUDE VARIATION (DAV) TIME SERIES TO IDENTIFY THE ONSET OF TYPICAL DAYTIME MELT WITH
 NIGHTTIME REFREEZE, AND TO IDENTIFY THE DURATION OF THIS MELT/REFREEZE CYCLING.
 ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED USING COARSE RESOLUTION PM OBSERVATIONS AT 25 KM SAMPLING AND GRIDDING
 RESOLUTIONS ON MEDIUM TO LARGE GLACIERIZED AREAS, WE HAVE RECENTLY DEMONSTRATED THAT ENHANCED
 SPATIAL RESOLUTION PM OBSERVATIONS CAN NOW BE EFFECTIVELY USED IN MORE HETEROGENOUS
 LANDSCAPES, INCLUDING LAND/WATER GRADIENTS AND TOPOGRAPHICALLY COMPLEX REGIONS. WE WILL BE
 USING THE NASA MEASURES CALIBRATED, ENHANCED-RESOLUTION BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURES
 (CETB) EARTH SYSTEM DATA RECORD (ESDR) TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND EVALUATE DAV ALGORITHM
 DETECTION OF MELT ONSET. WE WILL LEVERAGE THE IMPROVED SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF CETB PRODUCTS, AT
 3.125 KM, COMPARED TO 25 KM RESOLUTION OF LEGACY DATA PRODUCTS, WITH NEWLY-AVAILABLE PIXELLEVEL
 VARIABILITY STATISTICS, TO DEVELOP DAV ALGORITHM THRESHOLDS APPROPRIATE FOR SELECTED CLIMATE
 REGIMES AND LANDSCAPES.
 TO SUPPORT US ARMY ERDC OBJECTIVES TO USE THE PROPOSED RESEARCH TO SUPPORT ARMY OPERATIONAL

 TETRA TECH IS THE IMPLEMENTER OF THE ENERGY SECURITY PROJECT (ESP), A 7-YEAR PROJECT FUNDED BY THE UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT.
 
 THE PROJECT AIMS TO ENHANCE UKRAINEÂ  S ENERGY SECURITY BY ESTABLISHING COMPETITIVE ENERGY MARKETS WITH PROPER TRADING, POST-TRADING, AND REPORTING. WHILE ELECTRICITY AND GAS MARKETS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE ONGOING WAR, THEY ARE ADJUSTING TO THE NEW CLIMATE. FURTHERMORE, UKRAINEÂ  S CONNECTIVITY TO ENTSO-E IS EXPECTED TO GIVE THE ELECTRICITY MARKET A FURTHER BOOST, WHILE THE OVERALL POLITICAL LANDSCAPE IS SKEWED TOWARDS REFORMS.
 
 THE ENERGY MARKET DEVELOPMENT IS PREDICATED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF TRADING PLATFORMS AND POST-TRADE INFRASTRUCTURE, PARTICULARLY Â   CLEARING. PROPER CLEARING ALLOWS FOR THOROUGH RISK MANAGEMENT, EASE OF OPERATIONS, VELOCITY OF SETTLEMENTS, AND LEGAL CLARITY ON TITLE TRANSFER. UKRAINEÂ  S LAW ON CAPITAL AND ORGANIZED COMMODITIES MARKETS HAS COMPLETELY RESHAPED A CLEARING REGULATION AND WAS MOSTLY BASED ON THE EU REGULATIONS, PRIMARILY Â   EMIR. HOWEVER, IT IS IMPORTANT TO EVALUATE EXACTLY HOW WELL UKRAINIAN LEGISLATION ALLOWS FOR PROPER CLEARING TO BE ESTABLISHED AND HOW MUCH OF THE RELEVANT EU REGULATIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED. SUCH LEGAL ANALYSIS WILL EVALUATE THE DEGREE TO WHICH UKRAINIAN LEGISLATION CORRESPONDS TO THE EU ACQUIS AND IN GENERAL THE LEVEL OF IMPLEMENTATION OF EU LEGISLATION.
 
 TO ASSIST ANY EXISTING/POTENTIAL ENTITY WISHING TO PARTAKE IN CLEARING, USAID ESP IS SEEKING LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO PROVIDE A LEGAL GAP ANALYSIS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION LEVEL OF THE EUÂ  S RELEVANT LEGISLATION IN UKRAINE. THE FOCUS OF ASSIGNMENT IS COMMODITIES MARKETS (SPECIFICALLY GAS AND ELECTRICITY), WHOLESALE ENERGY PRODUCTS (INCLUDING ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS AS UNDERLYING ASSETS OF DERIVATIVES).
 THE UKRAINIAN LEGISLATION TO BE CONSIDERED NOT LIMITED TO LAW ON CAPITAL AND ORGANIZED COMMODITIES MARKETS, LAW ON COMMODITIES EXCHANGES, NATURAL GAS MARKET LAW, ELECTRICITY MARKET LAW, NEURC LAW, LAW ON CURRENCY AND CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS, CODES AND BY-LAWS (MARKET RULES, NSSMC LICENSING CONDITIONS ETC.).
 
 2.0 TASKS
 THE ASSIGNMENT SHOULD CONSIST OF THE FOLLOWING TASKS SUBJECT TO DISCUSSION AND NEGOTIATION.
 
 TASK 1: IDENTIFY THE DEGREE TO WHICH UKRAINE HAS IMPLEMENTED DIRECTIVE 98/26/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL OF 19 MAY 1998 ON SETTLEMENT FINALITY IN PAYMENT AND SECURITIES SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS (SFD) (OJ L 166, 11.6.1998).
 Â ¢ IDENTIFY UKRAINIAN LEGISLATION WHERE THE DIRECTIVE IS IMPLEMENTED, ASSESS THE COMPLETENESS OF RELEVANT PROVISIONS, AND IDENTIFY THE MISSING ELEMENTS.

 Â ¢ IDENTIFY UKRAINIAN LEGISLATION WHERE THE DIRECTIVE IS IMPLEMENTED, ASSESS THE COMPLETENESS OF RELEVANT PROVISIONS, AND IDENTIFY THE MISSING ELEMENTS.
 
 TASK 3: EXPLORE AND EXPLAIN WHETHER UKRAINE HAS IMPLEMENTED NOVATION IN ITS CLEARING LEGISLATION (I.E. EXISTING CONTRACT IS TERMINATED AND REPLACED BY TWO CONTRACTS WITH CCP Â   PURSUANT TO EMIR) OR OPEN OFFER (A CONTRACT IS CONCLUDED WITH CCP IMMEDIATELY AFTER MATCHING THE TRANSACTION, NO PRIOR BILATERAL CONTRACT).
 Â ¢ ANALYZE CURRENT PRIMARY AND SECONDARY LEGISLATION AND DESCRIBE THE EXISTENCE AND FUNCTIONALITY OF NOVATION AND/OR OPEN OFFER.
 
 TASK 4: ANALYZE THE FUNCTIONING OF NON-EMIR CLEARING HOUSES IN EU AND EXPLAIN WHETHER SUCH CLEARING MODEL CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN UKRAINE.
 Â ¢ IDENTIFY EU ACQUIS GOVERNING THE FUNCTIONING OF NON-EMIR CLEARING HOUSES IN THE EU.
 Â ¢ ANALYZE CURRENT PRIMARY AND SECONDARY UKRAINIAN LEGISLATION AND DESCRIBE THE POSSIBILITY OF FUNCTIONING OF NON-EMIR CLEARING HOUSES IN UKRAINE (WHAT PARTIES ARE INVOLVED IN SUCH CLEARING MODEL, WHAT TRANSACTION CAN BE CLEARED, ETC.).
 
 TASK 5: PROVIDE A LEGAL OPINION ON WHETHER UKRAINIAN LEGISLATION PROVIDES FOR CLEARING WITHOUT THE INSTITUTION OF NOVATION/OPEN OFFER (FOR SFD-COMPLIANT CLEARING HOUSES, NON-CCP).
 
 Â ¢ BASED ON THE CURRENT LEGISLATION, PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION ON WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE AN SFD-COMPLIANT CLEARING HOUSE IN UKRAINE WITHOUT PROVIDING NOVATION/OPEN OFFER.
 
 TASK 6: PROVIDE A LEGAL OPINION ON PROVIDING CLEARING SERVICES TO NON-RESIDENTS, PARTICULARLY EU PARTICIPANTS (INCLUDING THE NOMINATION OF SUCH PARTICIPANT AS A CLEARING MEMBER). WHAT ARE THE REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO CROSS-BORDER CLEARING (IF ANY)?
 
 Â ¢ ANALYZE CURRENT PRIMARY AND SECONDARY UKRAINIAN LEGISLATION PERTAINING TO CROSS-BORDER CLEARING (IF ANY).
 
 Â ¢ BASED ON THE CURRENT LEGISLATION, IDENTIFY, AND PROVIDE A LEGAL EXPLANATION OF THE ISSUES PERTAINING TO CROSS-BORDER CLEARING, CLEARING PARTICIPANT NOMINATION OF EU PARTIES, AND THE GENERAL PROCEDURE OF CLEARING THE POSITIONS OF NON-RESIDENTS:
 O IDENTIFY AND ANALYZE CLEARING MODELS THAT ARE ALLOWED BY UKRAINIAN LEGISLATION FOR CROSSBORDER TRANSACTIONS (E.G., WITH THE CENTRAL COUNTERPARTY, BY DETERMINING THE OBLIGATION, ETC.).
 O IDENTIFY AND ANALYZE ANY RESTRICTIONS APPLICABLE TO THE CROSS-BORDER CLEARING OF TRANSACTIONS (E.G., RELATED TO CURRENCY CONTROL, OPENING OF ACCOUNTS BY CLEARING PARTIES, REQUIREMENTS TO SETTLEMENT TRANSACTIONS, ETC.).
